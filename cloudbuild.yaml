# A configuration file for multi-arch image building with the Google cloud build service.
#
# Repos using this file must:
# - import csi-release-tools
# - add a symlink cloudbuild.yaml -> release-tools/cloudbuild.yaml
# - add a .cloudbuild.sh which can be a custom file or a symlink
#   to release-tools/cloudbuild.sh
# - accept "binary" as build argument in their Dockerfile(s) (see
#   https://github.com/pohly/node-driver-registrar/blob/3018101987b0bb6da2a2657de607174d6e3728f7/Dockerfile#L4-L6)
#   because binaries will get built for different architectures and then
#   get copied from the built host into the container image
#
# See https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/HEAD/config/jobs/image-pushing/README.md
# for more details on image pushing process in Kubernetes.

# To promote release images, see https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/tree/HEAD/k8s.gcr.io/images/k8s-staging-sig-storage.

# This must be specified in seconds. If omitted, defaults to 600s (10 mins).
# Building three images in external-snapshotter takes more than an hour.
timeout: 7200s
# This prevents errors if you don't use both _GIT_TAG and _PULL_BASE_REF,
# or any new substitutions added in the future.
options:
  substitution_option: ALLOW_LOOSE
steps:
  # The image must contain bash and curl. Ideally it should also contain
  # the desired version of Go (currently defined in release-tools/prow.sh),
  # but that just speeds up the build and is not required.
