# sig-storage-local-static-provisioner

The local volume static provisioner manages the PersistentVolume lifecycle for
pre-allocated disks by detecting and creating PVs for each local disk on the
host, and cleaning up the disks when released. It does not support dynamic
provisioning.

## Overview

Local persistent volumes allows users to access local storage through the
standard PVC interface in a simple and portable way.  The PV contains node
affinity information that the system uses to schedule pods to the correct
nodes.

An [external static provisioner](docs/provisioner.md) is provided here to help
simplify local storage management once the local volumes are configured. Note
that the local storage provisioner is different from most provisioners and does
not support dynamic provisioning.  Instead, it requires that administrators
preconfigure the local volumes on each node and if volumes are supposed to be

 1. Filesystem volumeMode (default) PVs - mount them under discovery directories.
 2. Block volumeMode PVs - create a symbolic link under discovery directory to
    the block device on the node.

The provisioner will manage the volumes under the discovery directories by creating
and cleaning up PersistentVolumes for each volume.

## User Guide

### Getting started

To get started with local static provisioning, you can follow our [getting
started guide](docs/getting-started.md) to bring up a Kubernetes cluster with
some local disks, deploy local-volume-provisioner to provision local volumes
and use PVC in your pod to request a local PV.

### Managing your local volumes

See our [operations](docs/operations.md) documentation which contains of
preparing, setting up and cleaning up local volumes on the nodes.

### Deploying

See our [helm](helm/README.md) documentation for how to deploy and configure
local-volume-provisioner in Kubernetes cluster with helm.

If you want to manage provisioner with plain YAML files, you can refer to our
[example yamls](deployment/kubernetes/example). [helm generated
yamls](helm/generated_examples/) are good sources of examples too.
[Here](docs/provisioner.md#configuration) is a full explanation of provisioner
configuration.

### Upgrading

See our [upgrading](docs/upgrading.md) documentation for how to upgrade
provisioner version or update configuration in Kubernetes cluster.

### FAQs

See [FAQs](docs/faqs.md).

### Best Practices

See [Best Practices](docs/best-practices.md).

## Version Compatibility

## K8s Feature Status

Also see [known issues](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) and [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

### 1.14: GA

* No new features added

### 1.12: Beta

* Added support for automatically formatting a filesystem on the given block device in `localVolumeSource.path`

### 1.10: Beta

* New PV.NodeAffinity field added.
* **Important:** Alpha PV NodeAffinity annotation is deprecated. Users must manually update
  their PVs to use the new NodeAffinity field or run a [one-time update job](utils/update-pv-to-beta).
* Alpha: Raw block support added.

### 1.9: Alpha

* New StorageClass `volumeBindingMode` parameter that will delay PVC binding
  until a pod is scheduled.

### 1.7: Alpha

* New `local` PersistentVolume source that allows specifying a directory or mount
  point with node affinity.
* Pod using the PVC that is bound to this PV will always get scheduled to that node.

### Future features

* Local block devices as a volume source, with partitioning and fs formatting
* Dynamic provisioning for shared local persistent storage
* Local PV health monitoring, taints and tolerations
* Inline PV (use dedicated local disk as ephemeral storage)
